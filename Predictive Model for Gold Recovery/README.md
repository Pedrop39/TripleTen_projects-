# Predictive Model for Gold Recovery

## Description

### Introduction
Welcome to the **Predictive Model for Gold Recovery** project! This initiative focuses on crafting a predictive model to estimate gold recovery rates from raw materials. Our goal? Deliver precise predictions using a rich dataset of process features to streamline operations and boost efficiency in the gold mining industry. By optimizing recovery, we aim to unlock greater value from every ounce of ore.

### Main Body
This project unfolds through a systematic, data-driven journey to predict gold recovery. Hereâ€™s how we made it happen:

1. **Data Loading and Initialization**  
   - Imported essential libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn`.  
   - Loaded a detailed dataset capturing the gold recovery process, packed with relevant features.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Examined the distribution of features and the target variable (gold recovery rate).  
   - Explored relationships between features and recovery rates through visualizations.  
   - Built correlation heatmaps to reveal key interactions among numerical variables.  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Tackled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.  
   - Normalized and scaled features for consistent model input.  
   - Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.  

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Experimented with Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.  
   - Measured performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared metrics.  
   - The Random Forest model shone brightest, delivering the lowest MAE and MSE, paired with the highest R-squared score.  

### Conclusion
The Random Forest model emerged as the standout performer, providing accurate and reliable predictions for gold recovery. Its ability to capture complex patterns in the data makes it an invaluable asset for optimizing the recovery process, paving the way for smarter, more efficient gold mining operations.

### Ideas for Further Improvement
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate domain-specific variables (e.g., ore grade, processing time) for richer predictions.  
- **Real-Time Integration**: Deploy the model in a production environment for live monitoring of recovery rates.  
- **Business Outcomes**: Use predictions to guide resource allocation or inform equipment upgrades for cost savings.  
- **Ensemble Boost**: Combine Random Forest with gradient boosting models (e.g., XGBoost) for even better accuracy.
