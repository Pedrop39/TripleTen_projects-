| 1              | [Automated Sentiment Analysis for Classic Movie Reviews](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Automated%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Classic%20Movie%20Reviews) | The project task was to develop a system to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using IMDB review data, aiming for an F1 score of at least 0.85. |
| 2              | [ Optimal Oil Well Location Selection](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Optimal%20Oil%20Well%20Location%20Selection)  | The project task was to identify the optimal location for a new oil well to maximize profit and minimize risk using predictive modeling and data analysis of oil samples from three regions. |
| 3              | [Predicting Customer Churn in Beta Bank](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Predicting%20Customer%20Churn%20in%20Beta%20Bank)           | The project task was to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave Beta Bank by analyzing historical data and aiming for an F1 score of at least 0.59. |
| 4              | [Predicting Mobile Plan Subscriptions](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Predicting%20Mobile%20Plan%20Subscriptions)             | The project task was to develop a predictive model to recommend the company's newer mobile plans (Smart or Ultra) to existing subscribers based on their historical behavior data, aiming for an accuracy threshold of 0.75. |
| 5              | [Predictive Model for Car Market Value](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Predictive%20Model%20for%20Car%20Market%20Value)            | The project task was to build a model to determine the market value of cars for Rusty Bargain's new app, focusing on prediction quality, speed, and training time, using historical data on technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. |
| 6              | [Predictive Model for Airport Taxi Orders](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Predictive%20Model%20for%20Airport%20Taxi%20Orders)         | The project task was to build a model to predict the amount of taxi orders at airports for the next hour, aiming to attract more drivers during peak hours. The model's RMSE on the test set should not exceed 48. |
| 7              |[ Machine Learning Solutions for Insurance Tasks](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20Solutions%20for%20Insurance%20Tasks)   | Evaluated machine learning for Sure Tomorrow to identify similar customers, predict insurance benefit likelihood, estimate number of benefits, and develop a data masking algorithm without compromising model quality. |
| 8              | [Predictive Model for Gold Recovery ](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Predictive%20Model%20for%20Gold%20Recovery)              | Developed a machine learning model for Zyfra to predict gold recovery from ore, optimizing production processes and enhancing efficiency through data preparation, analysis, and model development. |
| 9              | [Predicting Customer Churn for Telecom Operator Interconnect](https://github.com/Pedrop39/TripleTen_projects-/tree/main/Predicting%20Customer%20Churn%20for%20Telecom%20Operator%20Interconnect) | The project task was to develop predictive models to identify customer churn for Interconnect, enabling targeted promotions and special plans to enhance customer retention and loyalty, with a focus on AUC-ROC and accuracy metrics. |
